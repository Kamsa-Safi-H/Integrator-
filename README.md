## Connection Details:
•	Input signal → Resistor (R) → Inverting terminal (Pin 2)
•	Feedback capacitor (Cf) → Between Output (Pin 6) and Pin 2
•	Non-inverting terminal (Pin 3) → Ground
•	Pin 7 → +15V
•	Pin 4 → −15V
## Theory
An Integrator circuit produces an output voltage proportional to the integral of the input voltage.
## Working Principle:
•	When input is constant → output is ramp signal
•	Output is inverted
•	Output depends on time
For Sine Wave Input:
•	Output lags input by 90°
•	Output amplitude decreases with frequency

## Viva Questions
1. What is an integrator circuit?
An integrator circuit is an op-amp based circuit in which the output voltage is proportional to the time integral of the input voltage. It is commonly implemented using an operational amplifier with a resistor at the input and a capacitor in the feedback path.

2. Write the output equation of integrator.
   The output voltage of an ideal integrator is given by
             Vo​=−RC1​∫Vi​dt
   
3. Why does output lag input?
The output of an integrator lags the input because integration introduces a phase shift of −90°, which is due to the charging and discharging behavior of the capacitor in the feedback path.

4. What happens at very low frequency?
At very low frequencies or DC input, the capacitor behaves like an open circuit, causing the output voltage to increase continuously and drive the op-amp into saturation.

5. What is practical integrator?
A practical integrator is an improved integrator circuit in which a resistor is connected in parallel with the feedback capacitor to limit the gain at low frequencies and prevent saturation.
